Wireless [lcdproc display](http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/).

See old [blog article](https://programmablehardware.blogspot.com/2012/04/mock-pertelian.html).

The only difference between the current setup and that described in the article is the replacement of the Zigbee wireless module with a Bluetooth Serial Module. (Not only is this cheaper than a Zigbee but means it can be easily connected to from a Raspberry Pi Zero-W.)
